Note that not all of the activities are included.
The module decription describes that the activities are optional,
I skipped many of the ones for topics which I was comfortable with.
Some of these Activities may be incomplete or modified post completion,
since I used the code I made in these activities to test ideas,
and didn't revert them to the version I would have if the activities were "graded"
I intentionally am leaving the activities folder in the repository, so that you can
see which activities I did, and when I went back to them to test ideas.
