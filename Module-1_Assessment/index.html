    <p>
      I am Chris Yarnot. Recently, I graduated from Milwaukee School Of Engineering with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Engineering. 
      I am looking for a job.

      I've always had a passion for understanding how things work. 
      Originally this was exclusive to games, because when I was very little 
      I wanted to be a game designer.
      However when I started school, I very quickly learned that the process 
      I used to figure out how games work was very similar to the experimental 
      process used to figure out how the universe works. 
      I was ecstatic to attend science, and math courses from then on.
      Nowadays code and the machines that run it is my primary focus.
    </p>

      Videogames still fascenate me, however for different reasons. They tend
      to be very good examples of very complicated code. While I regularly play
      them in my free time, when I do play them I often have my laptop open
      with an excell spreadsheet. I'm of course gathering data on how they work,
      trying to reverse engineer them, and understand why the developers made the 
      choices they did.
