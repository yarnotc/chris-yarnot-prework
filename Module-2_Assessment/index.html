        Baba Is You is a puzzle video game created by Finnish indie developer Arvi Teikari (known professionally as Hempuli). It was released on 13 March 2019 for PC and Nintendo Switch.
        The game centers around the manipulation of "rules"—represented by tiles with words written on them—in order to allow the titular character Baba (or some other object) to reach a specified goal.
        The player, usually, controls a character known as Baba, with exceptions in some levels. Each level contains various movable word tiles, corresponding to specific types of objects and obstacles on the field, linking operators such as "is" and "and", and verb tiles reflecting the properties of these objects. 
        The objective of each level is for the player to reach the goal by manipulating these tiles to create or modify "rules" by which they behave. 
        For example, the goal can be changed by moving "is" and "win" blocks to another object, and the player can travel through objects by removing the "stop" trait from them.
        Levels can force specific rules by placing their blocks in a corner, so they cannot be moved.
